I am currently a research assistant at Shanghai AI Laboratory, where I am fortunate to work under the mentorship of Prof. [Xuelong Li](https://iopen.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1329/1171.htm). Before this, I obtained my **M.S. degree** from [National University of Defense Technology](https://www.nudt.edu.cn) in June 2023, advised by Prof. [Xin Xu](https://xueshu.baidu.com/scholarID/CN-B7736SUJ), and my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn).
    

<p>
<strong>Research Areas & Interests:</strong> robotics, computer vision, and deep reinforcement learning. 
</p>   
In particular, I am interested in embodied intelligence with a focus on representation learning for multi-modal perception and long-horizon planning via large language models (LLMs):
+ <font color='green'>Representation learning for multi-modal perception</font> How to learn object-generic tokens for prompts? And how to learn task-driven representations for efficient skill learning?
+ <font color='green'>Hierarchical embodied planning</font> How to define and decide the granularity of skills? How to close the loop between high-level skill sequences and low-level control signals for learning-based skills? And how can we solve the 'hand-off problems' of skill sequence?

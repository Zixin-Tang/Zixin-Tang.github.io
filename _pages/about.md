I am currently a research assistant at Shanghai AI Laboratory, where I am fortunate to work under the mentorship of Prof. [Xuelong Li](https://iopen.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1329/1171.htm). Before this, I obtained my M.S. degree from [National University of Defense Technology (NUDT)](https://www.nudt.edu.cn) in June 2023, advised by Prof. [Xin Xu](https://xueshu.baidu.com/scholarID/CN-B7736SUJ), and my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn).
    


Research Topics
------  
I am interested in <b>Embodied AI: Robotics, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Computer Vision</b>.
Recently, my research mainly focuses on leveraging LLMs to tackle long-horizon manipulation challenges in robotics:
+ Embodied planning via LLMs: Heterogeneous Multi-agent Task Planning. I am working on setting up heterogeneous multi-robot benchmark in simulation and contributing to our task planning method. Below is a demo video to demonstrate the key point of our tasks.

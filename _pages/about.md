I am a research assistant at [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn), working with Dong Wang and [Chenjia Bai](https://baichenjia.github.io). Prior to this, I obtained my **M.S. degree** in Control Science and Engineering from [National University of Defense Technology](https://www.nudt.edu.cn), advised by Prof. Dr. [Xin Xu](https://xueshu.baidu.com/scholarID/CN-B7736SUJ), and my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn).
    

<p>
<strong>Research Areas & Interests:</strong>
My research areas lie in robotics, computer vision, and deep reinforcement learning. 
</p>   
In particular, I am interested in embodied intelligence with focus on representation learning for multi-modal perception and long-horizon planning.
+ <font color='green'>Representation learning for multi-modal perception</font>: How to learn object-generic and task-driven representations is critical for efficient skill learning?
+ <font color='green'>Hierarchical embodied planning</font>: How to define and decide the granularity of skills? How to close the loop between high-level skill sequences and low-level control signals for learning-based skills? And how can we solve the “Hand over” problem of skill sequence?

I am currently a research assistant at Shanghai AI Laboratory, where I am fortunate to work under the mentorship of Prof. [Xuelong Li](https://iopen.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1329/1171.htm). Before this, I obtained my M.S. degree from [National University of Defense Technology (NUDT)](https://www.nudt.edu.cn) in June 2023, advised by Prof. [Xin Xu](https://xueshu.baidu.com/scholarID/CN-B7736SUJ), and my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn).
    

<p>
<strong>Research Areas & Interests:</strong> Embodied AI: Robotics, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Computer Vision. 
</p>   
Recently, my research mainly focuses on leveraging LLMs to tackle long-horizon manipulation challenges in robotics:
+ **Embodied planning via LLMs: Heterogeneous Multi-agent Task Planning** 
+ **Embodied control via LLMs: Long-horizon Bimanual Manipulation**
